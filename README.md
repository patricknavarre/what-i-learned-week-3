# what-i-learned-week-3

In week 3 I really started to learned the difference between `frontend` and `backend`.

The `frontend` of a website is what you see and interact with on your browser.  It's also referred to as "client-side".  It includes everything the user experiences directly.  Like the colors, text, buttons and images.

Frontend developers don't always "design" these front-facing parts of the site, this is the job of a web-designer aka "UI Designer".  The frontend developer takes the design and builds it into a functional site using coding languages like  `Javascript`, `HTML`, and `CSS`.

The `backend` or "server-side" is the part of the website that we don't see.  It's the part that stores, and organizes the data that makes sure the `frontend` actually works.  the `backend` and `frontend` communicate with each other sending and receiving info to be displayed on the website.  Whenever a user fills out a contact form, or makes a purchase on the website,  the browser (`frontend`) sends the info to the server (`backend`) which then send the info BACK to the `frontend`.  Got it?  ...yeah took me a sec too.  

## In week 3 we really started to put all of these things together and it was ROUGH...

We started applying how to use `functions` to call things from the `backend` to the `frontend`...
